## Git-React-App

Welcome to Jacob Miller's Git-React-App project!

This app allows a user to enter a username and repository name for
any public github repository. Then the user will see the latest commit history
for that repository. Users will be able to view the files changed within
each commit by using the dropdown chevron on each commit.

## Setup
In the project directory, run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm start`

to begin hosting the app. Then you can go to:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

to view it in the browser.
